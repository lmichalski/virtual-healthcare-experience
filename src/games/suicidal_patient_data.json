If at anytime you are unable to continue playing, please take a break or stop immediately. If you continue to feel triggered, please use the resources provided to obtain immediate support.",
        "This virtual gaming simulation will play a snap shot of a scenario followed by a question. Each question will have 3 decision points (one correct response, one somewhat correct response, and one incorrect response). The somewhat correct response and incorrect response will provide feedback to explain why it was not the best response; whereas, the correct response will allow you to continue playing the game. A final report on your performance will be provided upon completion.",
        "Kelly Flynn identifies as a 22-year-old cisgender female. Kelly relocated to Toronto, Ontario in the Fall to pursue her first year of the bachelor’s degree in environmental studies. Prior to relocating, Kelly grew up in a rural community with her parents and two younger siblings. Both her parents are second generation farmers, and regularly attend weekly mass at a local church. Kelly’s upbringing on the farm encouraged her to be a strong advocate for sustainable living and environmental protection. Kelly decided to pursue her passion in environmental studies. Initially, Kelly’s parents were disappointed but agreed to financially and emotionally support her decision.",
        "Shortly before the commencement of the first semester, Talia was assigned to be Kelly’s roommate on campus. Kelly and Talia were instantly able to form a strong connection as they were both enrolled in the same program and had similar passions. Towards the end of the Fall semester, Talia noticed that Kelly became distant, less communicative and had difficulty getting out of bed. Talia also notes that Kelly was coming home late from parties, was frequently intoxicated and would often miss classes. During exams, Kelly was very anxious and attempted to suicide by mixing over the counter medication and alcohol. Talia suggested that Kelly attend the Drop-In Wellness Centre at school. Kelly agreed and received support from Marcus, a counsellor, at the Wellness Centre. Kelly only attended one session but reported she was feeling much better.",
        "Due to financial restrictions, Kelly was unable to return home during the Winter holidays and stayed on-campus. Talia felt comfortable leaving Kelly alone as she had reporting she was feeling better and returned to her hometown for the holidays. When Talia returned from her holiday vacation, she noticed that Kelly looked unkept, lost a lot of weight, and their dorm was filled with alcohol bottles. Kelly reported she failed most of her classes last semester and was not doing well emotionally. Talia suggested that Kelly go to the Wellness Centre. Initially Kelly resists the idea of seeking professional help again, but after seeing the concern from Talia and some discussion Kelly agrees to make an appointment to see Marcus. Talia decided to accompany Kelly to her appointment."
